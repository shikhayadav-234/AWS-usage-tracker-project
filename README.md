## 📖 Project Overview  
This project is a **Linux Mini Project** that tracks AWS service usage and cost through CLI commands on an **EC2 instance**.  
It is part of my **DevOps learning journey** where I explored Linux commands, AWS CLI, and GitHub integration.

## 🛠️ Skills Practiced  
- Linux basics (`mkdir`, `touch`, `nano`, `cp`, `mv`, `ls`, `chmod`, `rm`)  
- File handling & log redirection  
- Cron jobs for automation  
- AWS CLI setup and usage  
- Git & GitHub workflow

## 📂 Project Structure  

linux-mini-project/
├── project1.sh # Shell script for tracking AWS usage
├── project1.log # Log file storing execution results
└── README.md # Project documentation

---

## 🚀 How It Works  
1. A shell script (`project1.sh`) runs AWS CLI commands.  
2. Output is logged into `project1.log`.  
3. The log file is monitored using `tail -f` for real-time updates.  
4. Cron jobs can automate periodic runs.

## 📌 Future Enhancements  
- Automate report generation with cron  
- Add email/SNS notification for alerts  
- Integrate with **CloudWatch metrics**
